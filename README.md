# Fiducial Marker Experiments

This code was created in the beginning of 2016 as a mean to refresh
my knowledge of OpenCV by making something.

You will find here a design for fiducial markers and software that can
successfully detect them.

The code as it stands today has been built and run with OpenCV 3.1.0, and
it is known to not compile with OpenCV 2.x.
